## How to Calculate the Volume Oscillator

The Volume Oscillator is calculated as follows:

\`\`\` Volume Oscillator = \[(Shorter Period SMA of Volume -- Longer
Period SMA of Volume) / Longer Period SMA of Volume \] \* 100 \`\`\`

## How to Use the Volume Oscillator

The Volume Oscillator can be used to identify trend reversals, confirm
support and resistance levels, and measure the strength of a trend.

-   **Trend reversals:** When the Volume Oscillator crosses above zero,
    it indicates that the short-term volume moving average has risen
    above the longer-term volume moving average, and thus, that the
    short-term volume trend is higher (i.e., more volume) than the
    longer-term volume trend. This suggests that a trend reversal may be
    underway.
-   **Support and resistance:** A support break on increasing volume
    indicates a stronger move than a support break on low volume.
    Similarly, a resistance break on expanding volume shows more buying
    intensity.
-   **Trend strength:** The Volume Oscillator can also be used to
    measure the strength of a trend. A strong trend will be accompanied
    by a high Volume Oscillator reading.
